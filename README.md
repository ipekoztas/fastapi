**Project Title: FastAPI JWT Authentication with PostgreSQL and Docker**

This GitHub project demonstrates the implementation of user authentication using FastAPI, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), PostgreSQL, and Docker. The primary goal of this project is to provide a secure and efficient way for users to sign up and receive JWT tokens, with user data being stored in a PostgreSQL database. The use of Docker further simplifies the deployment process, making it easy to set up and run the project across different environments.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Registration and Authentication:** The project allows users to sign up by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password. Upon successful registration, users receive a JWT token, which serves as their authentication credential for accessing protected routes.

2. **JWT Token Generation and Verification:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are employed to manage user authentication. A JWT token is generated during the user registration process and is subsequently used for authenticating API requests. The project also incorporates token verification to ensure secure communication between the client and the server.

3. **PostgreSQL Database Integration:** User data, including user credentials, is stored in a PostgreSQL database. This provides a structured and reliable storage solution for user information, allowing for efficient retrieval and management of user records.

4. **API Endpoints:** The FastAPI framework is utilized to create various API endpoints, including user registration, token generation, and protected routes. These endpoints facilitate user interaction with the system and the retrieval of user-specific data.

5. **Containerization with Docker:** Docker is employed to containerize the application, encapsulating its dependencies and configurations. This makes it easy to deploy the project across different environments without worrying about compatibility issues.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the database configuration in the project.
3. Build the Docker container using the provided Dockerfile.
4. Run the Docker container to start the FastAPI application.
5. Use a tool like Postman to interact with the API endpoints. Register users, obtain JWT tokens, and make authenticated requests.

**Why This Project Matters:**

This project showcases a practical implementation of user authentication using FastAPI, JWT tokens, PostgreSQL, and Docker. It addresses fundamental security concerns in web applications while providing an organized and containerized deployment approach. Developers interested in building secure and scalable applications can use this project as a foundation to understand how to integrate these technologies effectively.

By open-sourcing this project, it contributes to the developer community's knowledge and provides a valuable resource for learning and building upon these technologies.
